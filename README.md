# Kaim Week 0 Project

This repository contains the tasks and analyses for the Kaim Week 0 Data Science project. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize solar radiation and related weather data, gain insights from the dataset, and build interactive dashboards.

## Project Overview

This project will involve the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, clean the data, and look for any insights or anomalies.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: We will apply statistical methods to further analyze the data.
3. **Dashboard Development**: Using **Streamlit**, we will build a dynamic dashboard to visualize the insights gained from the data.
4. **Deployment**: The dashboard will be deployed to Streamlit Cloud for public access.
